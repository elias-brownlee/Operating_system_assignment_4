Page Replacement Algorithms
This code has three ways to decide which pages to keep in memory when there's not enough space.

What it does
It simulates three different algorithms:

LRU (Least Recently Used): Removes the page that hasn't been used in the longest time.
Optimal: Removes the page that won't be needed for the longest time in the future.
FIFO (First-In-First-Out): Removes the oldest page.
